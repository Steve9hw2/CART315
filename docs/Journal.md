  A game I’ve been recently playing which has interested me greatly is Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy. It consists of the fourth through sixth mainline entries of the Ace Attorney franchise, a series of visual novels known for their court drama and fantastic soundtracks. Part of what makes the mechanics of the series so fascinating to me is the way the series expertly explores lock and key design by making all sorts of logic puzzles for trial sections which require keys found naturally through investigating that you may have forgotten about. The feel of getting to investigate a situation firsthand (or being thrust into something with zero prep or warning) makes the satisfaction of exposing contradictory facts and statements in a trial setting all that much greater. This is helped by the stellar animation and sound design, which take the scene from a tense, desperate situation to one of triumphant turnabout, as the music blasts a victory cry and the opposing characters are left baffled. To break down the mechanics further, investigations involve navigating locations involved in a crime and finding evidence firsthand. This often includes discovering what seems like trivial information, such as newspaper clippings or objects received from a defendant or suspect. Along the way, as the defense attorney you somehow always seem to discover facts unknown to the prosecution or police, needing to reveal it in court at the right time to make your case.

  As for the actual trial sections, the game’s puzzles are presented in the form of witness testimony, through which you need to identify a contradictory statement as well as the evidence which conflicts with it yourself. The series has had stumbles in the past in which you may accidentally beat the game to the punch, presenting a solution for a puzzle later down the line and failing the current one. Thankfully, the series has improved on this issue over time. Looking for what I’d like to take away from the series, part of that is of course the ingenuity involved in lock and key puzzle development. Lock and key designs usually suffer from an inflexibility of keys, or from the locks being far too obvious or repetitive. Ace Attorney’s obfuscation of the locks and natural incorporation of an array of keys helps relieve this issue. Additionally, while I’m completely incapable of creating music and not the greatest animator, the idea of providing contrasting animations, music or writing as a reward to a puzzle is something worth carrying forward with my own work as it greatly amplifies the feeling of a reward in a player to see the situation change as a result of their work. As someone whose past work involves many puzzle games, there’s quite a lot I can bring forward in terms of improving lock and key design and reward moments.

## Ideation Journal

  For my ideation for CART 315, I started by focusing on two key ideas: one: that I'd like to work on a 3D Platformer of some kind, and two: that i'd like to work on the design value of Skill, Strategy, Chance and Uncertainty. The first of three ideas which stuck out to me came during in-class ideation. I'll label it Bacula; it involves a Dracula-like character whose head is backwards, making the camera angle for the game's 3D platforming backwards. This means that levels include all sorts of mirrors in order to view what lies ahead of him. This concept derived from a keyword combination I came up with: "camera challenge". The difficulty involved with movement would be a unique, easily controlled aspect. The second idea I came up with is a 3D Platformer which has roughly 50 playable characters - all a group which follows eachother closely, similarly to a trail. This is roughly equivalent to a 3D version of an earlier project of mine, Lemmings, and a much older PC game of the same name.

  The challenge would come from hazards following a set timing, and the navigation of the group requiring planning so that each member can safely traverse. This is an idea that I think has a lot of potential, but may also pose much more significant technical challenges. The third idea is rather peculiar- I'd call it a random platformer. Here, levels' whole structure is randomly generated, using a mixture of random architecture segments and hazards to make for platforming challenges which are unpredictable and potentially varying in difficulty or solution. This project would involve a need for many, many variations in order to have them remain consistently interesting, though its technicals are comparatively simple. As of writing this, I'm unsure which direction I'll pursue for a demo. I hope that, this time next week, I'll have a clear direction sorted so that I may make something that'll be useful to the creation of something tangible.

## Prototype 1

  My first prototype is focused on my idea which posed the notion of a camera angle as a challenge - as in the player needs to use mirrors to orient themselves around in a space. This prototype uses basic 3D platformer movement and mirrors in the space, with a basic stairwell hidden from view of the main camera but visible in the near mirror. As I worked on making the prototype, I found that mirrors were both surprisingly complex and somewhat simpler than anticipated - namely in that they involve multiple steps, but are relatively straightforward. The movement system I implemented is fairly simple, with a slight coasting issue that my playtester identified. During playtesting, my playtester was amused by the feeling of moving around in relation to mirrors instead of a proper camera, pointing to the notion that an interesting game could be made out of that system. For my next prototype, I'll explore camera tracking along a path, as to shift the camera forward along the reflective path as the player moves further along, just so that they aren't stuck looking at a tiny pixel to find themselves.

## Prototype 2

  My second prototype was focused on the shifting on camera angles - based on the sort of fixed perspective found in older games such as Resident Evil. Since my first prototype was about mirrors and perspective within one angle, I felt it worth exploring how the camera angles shifting could feel, as to have the very basic tech required down. This prototype features the same movement system as my first prototype, which means that as camera perspectives shift, the movement becomes offset from the perspective, making it challenging to find your way around the geometry. I had a friend test this prototype, who commented on how trippy it was having to move around with a movement axis separate from the actual perspective. He found it cool how i designed the actual landscape of the test "level", with the path, though short, climbing up on the same walls that box in the lower levels. My friend's comment is something I noted myself about the feel of the prototype, making it tempting to make the game centered around a sort of dense urban environment, as to feature interesting environments. In terms of movement, I feel that the challenging perspective is conflicting with the notion of platforming, meaning I have to decide between the two. For my iterative prototype, I seek to explore a combination of my explorations, introducing a better movement system that can accomodate platforming relative to the camera viewpoint.

## Iteration 1

  For my first iteration of the project, I decided to start by replacing the rather shoddy movement system I used with a more robust one that's camera relative - allowing for far easier control, and thus, more interesting layouts as well as platforming. Next, I merged the mirrors and camera switches together in one short scene of platforming, in order to get a proper feel for the mechanics in unison and gauge whether or not they could offer an interesting experience. Put together, the project feels like an interesting blend between oldschool horror games (due to the forced perspectives) and standard platforming, making it extremely malleable to whatever genre I choose. Additionally, the progression of camera angles lends the project a feeling of exploration - not necessarily of true adventure, but of a more streamlined nature, such as that which would be found in action games such as Uncharted, Tomb Raider and the like. I had a my same friend test this version of the project, and he mused that adding some sort of stressor element - be it a time limit, or thing to run from, would provide a much needed element of opposition - completing the fundamentals of a gameplay loop present in this iteration. As I reflect on such an idea, I'm considering modelling various generic assets for the environment, as to enhance the game feel. My main goal for the next prototype will be to add some form of opposition - though I'm not quite sure whether I'm seeking to go the horror route, or for something more aracde oriented.
