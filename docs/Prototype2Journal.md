 My second prototype was focused on the shifting on camera angles - based on the sort of fixed perspective found in older games such as Resident Evil. Since my first prototype was about mirrors and perspective within one angle, I felt it worth exploring how the camera angles shifting could feel, as to have the very basic tech required down. This prototype features the same movement system as my first prototype, which means that as camera perspectives shift, the movement becomes offset from the perspective, making it challenging to find your way around the geometry.
 I had a friend test this prototype, who commented on how trippy it was having to move around with a movement axis separate from the actual perspective. He found it cool how i designed the actual landscape of the test "level", with the path, though short, climbing up on the same walls that box in the lower levels. 
 My friend's comment is something I noted myself about the feel of the prototype, making it tempting to make the game centered around a sort of dense urban environment, as to feature interesting environments. In terms of movement, I feel that the challenging perspective is conflicting with the notion of platforming, meaning I have to decide between the two. For my iterative prototype, I seek to explore a combination of my explorations, introducing a better movement system that can accomodate platforming relative to the camera viewpoint.
